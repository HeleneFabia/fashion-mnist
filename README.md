# Deep Learning with fashion MNIST

After spending several weeks on studying the theory behind Deep Learning and Neural Network, I wanted to get hands-on experience and practice implementing NNs with PyTorch. The dataset I use for this project is [fashionMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist), which has the same properties as the famous MNIST dataset, but uses pictures of ten types of Zalando articles instead of hand-written digits.

### Project Updates

September 2020:
 - preprocessed the data
 - built a dataset and dataloader
 - built a baseline model (NN with two fully connected layers)
